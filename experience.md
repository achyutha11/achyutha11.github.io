## Research Experience

#### Independent Researcher
**AI Safety Research Collaboration**
*Remote | December 2025 - Present*

* Engineered an evaluation harness using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs to simulate reinforcement learning training.
* Evaluated frontier models (GPT 5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, etc.) on their propensity to resist RL training under misaligned goals, identifying a novel failure mode in AI models.

#### Research Fellow
**Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR)**
*Remote | September 2025 - Present*

* Developed evaluation pipelines to quantify goal drift in language model agents on long-horizon tasks.
* Designed experiments to study how conditioning stronger models on weaker models’ context affects goal drift.
* Led the writing and submission of the first-author paper to ICLR Workshop 2026.

#### Research Assistant
**Trustworthy ML Lab**
*La Jolla, California | June 2025 - August 2025*

* Investigated chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and faithfulness in large language models.
* Developed and tested steering-vector methods for improving CoT faithfulness, achieving promising preliminary results on the “hint” setup from Chen et al. (2025).

## Industry Experience

#### Associate Data Scientist, Refinance Team
**Jerry Services Inc.**
*Chicago, Illinois | December 2023 - July 2024*

* Led the analysis of A/B tests and development of ML models for the refinancing product which reduced credit pull costs by 70% with no negative impact on loan volume.
