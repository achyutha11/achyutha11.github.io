Hi, I'm **Achu**. I'm an AI Safety researcher and Master's student at **UC San Diego** (Class of 2026), where I focus on model evaluations and interpretability.

I'm currently working on understanding **goal drift** in agents and **faithfulness** in chain-of-thought reasoning. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at **Jerry** in Chicago, and before that, I studied Molecular Engineering at the **University of Chicago**.

Outside of research, I enjoy thinking about football (Arsenal FC), singing, reading, and dancing.

Check out my [Experience](experience) and [Publications](publications) to learn more about my work.
