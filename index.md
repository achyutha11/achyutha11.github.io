Hello! I'm Achu, a second-year master's student in computer science at UC San Diego, specializing in AI. I'm currently interested in AI safety research around chain-of-thought faithfulness and monitorability. Before getting to San Diego, I was a data scientist at a fintech startup, and before that, I studied molecular engineering at UChicago. Outside of work, I enjoy playing / following football (soccer), singing, and dancing.
